This project implements the **HRCM (Hidden Regularized Compression Model)** algorithm for genome compression.
The algorithm is specifically designed to efficiently compress biological sequences, such as DNA, by taking advantage of redundancies and repetitive structures commonly found in genome data.

The HRCM algorithm is tailored for **FASTA format** genomic sequences and consists of three main steps:

1. Extraction of non-compressible information
2. First-level compression
3. Second-level compression
